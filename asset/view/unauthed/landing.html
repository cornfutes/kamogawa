  </div>
  <div class="content content-narrow 🤍">
    <p>
      Your cloud infrastructure is growingly complex and fragmented.<br />
      The resource information you seek is a needle in a haystack.<br />
      Cloud platforms' UI consoles are bloated but lacking.<br />
      You don't have time to wire up high-friction APIs.<br />
      Documentations increases confusion.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Our automation integrates with AWS, GCP, and Azure to
      catalogue, then make resources accessible to your engineers
      and make the numbers make sense to your business folks.
      Our mission is to make cloud work for you, because the other way around does not.

      <p>We provide the best-in-class web console
        for all your cloud management needs.
        We are not constrained by organizational challenges that prevent
        cloud platforms from delivering software that make sense.
      </p>
      <p>In fact, cloud vendors are disincentivized from
        facilitating multi-cloud adoption. The full potential
        of cloud-native has yet to be realized by organizations, ironically inhibited
        by these utility services. We believe we can make money without being evil.
        This translates to making your cloud operation easier and more cost-effective.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our edge is in what we lack:
      <ul>
        <li>Bloated 20MB+ bundles of JavaScript/CSS</li>
        <li>Cluttered UIs mirroring the cloud vendors'
          org structure rather than what is applicable to your workflow</li>
        <li>Uninspired material design </li>
        <li>Irrelevant content for a theoretical frankenstein client</li>
      </ul>
      Our product roadmap is driven by utility.
      Support for web browsers that are NOT desktop Chrome is
      also important.

      <h2 class="🍜">One API</h2>
      <p>When you need more expressive queries or
        automation at scale, we have a
        GraphQL API. A single API to integrate and familiarize with,
        rather than a dozen quirky ones.
      </p>
      <p>Incentive structures at cloud vendors lead to APIs provided that are
        half-baked at launch, then in an ambiguous state of maintenance.
        SDKs and libraries are inconsistently implemented. They are
        subject to idiosyncrasies at the whim of individual developers,
        especially in ecosystems that are $NOT_JAVA. Autogen is not a panacea,
        either.
      </p>
      <p>
        Documentation is the worst. For example, there are 2.5x sets of
        documentation alluding to authentication with GCP APIs.
        In the end, you have to dig through source code to
        uncover a specific parameter, how to
        pass it, and finally correlate this to your specific library / API version.
        This is a failed abstraction that puts the burden
        of fragile integration code on your team.
      </p>
      <p>
        We manage the complexities of vendoring and versioning issues,
        so you have reliability and predictability.
        We are uniquely positioned for economy-of-scale in regard to
        smoothing out API quirks once-and-for-all.
        Your software engineering woes are literally our business.
        Payment processors existed before Stripe, and we're kind of
        like Stripe, but for Cloud vendors rather than banks.

          <p>
            We lift out provisional patterns, so you can think about code
            rather than details of a specific cloud vendor.
            Unlike the serverless offerings by cloud vendors,
            we do not obfuscate the implementation details.
            We merely hide details up front, but our serverless platform
            is open in the sense that the implementation
            details is always available and accessible to you.
            For example, Cloud Functions provisions Compute instances
            under neath the hood. We will containerize your serverless
            code in a transparent and portable way, and host it as
            a non leaky abstraction Compute Instance, or whatever cloud
            hosting platform is the most cost-effective.

          <p>By consolidating

            smoothing over their idiosyncracies, we reduce vendor risk.
            One direct benefit of our platform is
            reducing your operational costs by migrating workloads to the
            cost-effective cloud vendor on-demand.
