  - VSCode is great
    - Postgres, Docker Intellisense, Go tooling 
  - Disabled backups on CloudSQL
  - Docs
    - Split
  - Docker
    - realized didn't need Air in remote build
    - realized don't need Postgres logic in CloudRun. Wouldn't work either ways
    - Can grossly simplify build for prod. reduced image 200mb -> 30mb 
    - attempted using =scratch= instead of alpine but revealed we have OS dep

** 2022 Sep 16 
  - Added e2e test automation w/ Playwright. For now, just-ad hoc against prod.
    - took less than half a day
    - probably comparable to the product of Japan's hot test automation startup.
      - Goes to show lack of hard tech in Japan
    - Playwright debug mode is awesome. Can interactiely step through and debug.
    - Masks: can mask out UI elements whether it is for confidentiality reasons
      or avoiding flakiness ( for example, when the specific values in the UI 
        between run )s
    - note: Playwright developed by Microsoft
      - ironically, there are some issues on Windows machines
        - in WSL ( unix simulator ), compatibility issues with x11 preventing 
          debug mode of Playwright
  - Abandoned Gitlab for Github
    - Gitlab experience was mediocre thus far. 
    - Final nail in the coffin was CI/CD bug or shadow ban
    - Product-wise, Gitlab only has 400 free CI/CD minutes a month versus
      2,000-4,000 on Github. Assuming 2 CI/CD minutes per build, and a
      conservative 500+ commits a month, Gitlab just doesn't cut it.
    - No CI/CD integration with GCP
    - It's ironic because Gitlab is pushing really hard on CI/CD but it 
      feels not very well thought out.
  - Configured CI/CD ( deploy to GCR )
    - Could not configure Gitlab
      - originally, account was missing credit card and couldn't use CI/CD
      - after adding credit card, still couldn't test CI/CD
        - could not see "settings > CI/CD" alluded to be docs. seem to be user 
          set bit, as David could see but Louis could not. we decided to just
          abandon Gitlab altogether
    - Build, not deploy
      - We still want manual verification and releasing.
      - However, with CD, we always have image ready to deploy in CloudRun
    - Bisect
      - We tag the build with the Git commit hash, so now we can quickly bisect
        to a stable release
    - Got Google Cloud Build working, but preferred Github or anyone else.
      - Opaque billing and business model
      - Proprietary configuration format with less community support
      - slow. 2min+ builds
      - mediocre UI
      - small nuanced of affecting CloudRun UI
    - Went with Github Actions
      - 2,000-4,000 free CI/CD. Better than Gitlab. Better than Cloud Build?
        - here is priceshit for Google Cloud Build. https://cloud.google.com/build/pricing
          Why do users have to know about VM machine types?
      - Better UI than the rest
  - Settled on Github Actions
    - Billed for runtime
      - Weird way of rounding up:
        - total duration 1m 57s, but billable time 3minutes not 2minutes
  - GCP IAM
    - Finally understand:
      - Roles consist of permissions, which are the atoms
      - Can define custom roles 
      - Security theater. InfoSec risk.
      - GCP DevRel docs refer to internal role name, not searchable in UI
    - very terrible UI:
      - Service Accounts Page
        - Details page has no information about the service account's role....
        - The "Manage access" account CTA does not populate base on selected
          service accounts / "principals"
        - No link or way to edit roles. Must go to IAM
      - IAM Page
        - Can associate role to principals
        - UI tools allow search by Role Name, i.e. "AAM Viewer:,  not By Role
          ID such as roles/dialogflow.aamViewer, which GCP's devrel for this
          alludes to
  - GCP Supply Chain Risk
    - Bad GCP DevRel docs poses supply chain risk
      1. On GitHub, there are predefined templates. One of which is deploy to CloudRun.
      2. This template includes a build step google-github-actions/auth
        - https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth
      3. GCP DevRel added template, but it's broken. Docs are distracting, too.
        - turns out the file they checked in was missing special key 
          - people at GCP do not check their work or deploy to GCP even 
      4. first, we need to add 'roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator' to
        the service account to auth 
      5. was getting empty access_token values back. turns out we need to 
         add special property "token_format: 'access_token'". 
      6. then push to GCR failed. Error with missing 'storage.buckets.get' 
        permissions. It turns out we need the '' was insufficient. We originally
        gave the service account 'cloud-platform' ( reaad/write) permissions,
        which is far too wide and poses risk of compromised deleted our project,
        for example.
      7. The 'Container Registry Service Agent' lacked the permissions (
          storage.buckets.get).
         This is a very misleading role. In the end, we didn't even need this 
         role. "Cloud Build Service Account" had this.
      8. There are also project level roles versus individual resources.
         When creating service account, it's easy to give project wide permissions
         to read/write.
      9. With all this complexity, imagine if a malicious party owned this 
         3rd Github Actions template / repo and now have access to the entire
         project.
  - GCP DevRel
    - GitHub actions template was broken, stale outdated. The property we used 
      is deprecated. So the deprecated option is the only one that works.
    - Zero mention of "Cloud Build Service Account" or role for GCR 
    - leaky abstraction of storage buckets permission. GCP should add that 
      permission to "Cloud Build Service Account"
    - Supply chain risk given that GCP docs are terrible, and humans are human,
      will err on the side of trust and accidentally grant access to a malicious 
      fake repo
  - Cloud Build
    - here's a priceshit https://cloud.google.com/build/pricing
  - Github 
    - user-owned repos can only have one owner, everyone else is maintainer
    - maintainer cannot see settings such as secrets used by Github Actions
    - Created Org 
      - transfered ownership from repo to org
        - super dodgy transfer mechanism. if typo, can send repo to unintended
          party. lacking two-way handshake mechanism for proof of ownership.
      - made David and Louis owners of the org
      - Public page, but members private by default ( good )
    - Observed they are selling teams and other products now
  - Cleanup GCP
    - removed old GCR repos in linear-cinema-360910 (kanazawa2)
      - Goal: save server costs 
      - product observations:
        - noticed if you delete all images, repo disappears  
        - noticed you can't delete entire repo. must delete image by image
      - ~100mb/image. We removed maybe 50 images.
    - Remove service accounts
      - Goal: infosec 
    - Is it safe to rename project without breaking things? ü§∑üèª
